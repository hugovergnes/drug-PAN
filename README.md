# drug-graph-convolutional-kernel
This is an implementation of a Path Integral Based Convolution Graph Neural Network to solve the molhiv dataset on OGB.

## Prerequisites

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the code folder (cd code)
3. Run your first training (python lightning_train.py

## Features
This training was mainly ran on a laptop CPU. If you want to run it on a GPU for free using collab, we made a readily implemented notebook to run on collab.
You ll need to upload it on collab as well as Norm.py, model.py, lightning_model.py and parameters.json and the notebook will take care of installing all other dependencies.
